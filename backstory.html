                    The story of Destiny 2 is a sprawling epic set in a futuristic universe where humanity, scattered
                    across
                    different planets and moons, faces constant threats from various hostile alien races. Here's a
                    condensed
                    version
                    of the story thus far:

                <p class="BackstoryBody">
                    Centuries ago, humanity experienced a golden age of technological advancement, thanks to the
                    discovery
                    of the
                    Traveler, a mysterious celestial being that brought prosperity and new worlds to explore. However,
                    this
                    age of
                    enlightenment was short-lived as an ancient enemy known as the Darkness, followed by its army, the
                    Hive,
                    descended upon humanity, leading to a cataclysmic event known as the Collapse. The Collapse brought
                    ruin
                    to
                    human civilization, and the Traveler was left crippled above Earth.

                    The Last City and the Guardians:
                    In the aftermath of the Collapse, what remained of humanity gathered beneath the Traveler, forming
                    the
                    Last City
                    on Earth. The Traveler, in its weakened state, created Ghosts, small sentient drones imbued with its
                    Light, to
                    seek out and resurrect individuals who could wield its power. These resurrected warriors became
                    known as
                    Guardians, tasked with defending humanity and reclaiming lost worlds from the alien threats.

                    The Red War:
                    In Destiny 2, the story begins with a devastating surprise attack on the Last City by the Red
                    Legion, a
                    faction
                    of the Cabal, a militaristic alien empire. Led by Dominus Ghaul, the Red Legion seeks to capture the
                    Traveler
                    and harness its power for themselves. Ghaul succeeds in capturing the Traveler and draining its
                    Light,
                    stripping
                    Guardians of their abilities. Players, assuming the role of a Guardian, must reclaim their powers,
                    rally
                    allies
                    from across the solar system, and confront Ghaul to save humanity and the Traveler.

                    Following the events of the Red War, Destiny 2 has seen the release of several expansions, each
                    introducing new
                    threats and expanding the game's lore. These expansions include "Curse of Osiris," where players
                    confront the Vex on Mercury, "Warmind," which sees the return of the
                    AI
                    Warmind
                    Rasputin, "Forsaken," which delves into the story of
                    Cayde-6's
                    death and the rise of the Scorn, and "Shadowkeep," where Guardians confront the nightmarish forces
                    on
                    the Moon.

                    behind the
