            <h1>The Story of Destiny 2</h1>
            <p class="BackstoryBody">
                The story of Destiny 2 is a sprawling epic set in a futuristic universe where humanity, scattered across
                different planets and moons, faces constant threats from various hostile alien races. Here's a condensed
                version
                of the story thus far:

            <h1 id="year0">Year 0: Before Destiny 2:</h1>
            <p class="BackstoryBody">
                Centuries ago, humanity experienced a golden age of technological advancement, thanks to the discovery
                of the
                Traveler, a mysterious celestial being that brought prosperity and new worlds to explore. However, this
                age of
                enlightenment was short-lived as an ancient enemy known as the Darkness, followed by its army, the Hive,
                descended upon humanity, leading to a cataclysmic event known as the Collapse. The Collapse brought ruin
                to
                human civilization, and the Traveler was left crippled above Earth.

                The Last City and the Guardians:
                In the aftermath of the Collapse, what remained of humanity gathered beneath the Traveler, forming the
                Last City
                on Earth. The Traveler, in its weakened state, created Ghosts, small sentient drones imbued with its
                Light, to
                seek out and resurrect individuals who could wield its power. These resurrected warriors became known as
                Guardians, tasked with defending humanity and reclaiming lost worlds from the alien threats.

                The Red War:
                In Destiny 2, the story begins with a devastating surprise attack on the Last City by the Red Legion, a
                faction
                of the Cabal, a militaristic alien empire. Led by Dominus Ghaul, the Red Legion seeks to capture the
                Traveler
                and harness its power for themselves. Ghaul succeeds in capturing the Traveler and draining its Light,
                stripping
                Guardians of their abilities. Players, assuming the role of a Guardian, must reclaim their powers, rally
                allies
                from across the solar system, and confront Ghaul to save humanity and the Traveler.

                Following the events of the Red War, Destiny 2 has seen the release of several expansions, each
                introducing new
                threats and expanding the game's lore. These expansions include "Curse of Osiris," where players team up
                with
                the legendary Warlock Osiris to confront the Vex on Mercury, "Warmind," which sees the return of the AI
                Warmind
                Rasputin as Guardians face off against the Hive on Mars, "Forsaken," which delves into the story of
                Cayde-6's
                death and the rise of the Scorn, and "Shadowkeep," where Guardians confront the nightmarish forces on
                the Moon
                and face the return of the Hive's ancient deity, Crota, and his father, Oryx.

                Beyond Light and The Witch Queen:
                Most recently, "Beyond Light" introduced players to Europa, where they confront Eramis, the Fallen Kell
                of
                Darkness, and wield the power of Stasis, a new element of Darkness. "The Witch Queen" expansion delves
                into the
                long-awaited confrontation with Savath√ªn, the sister of Oryx, who has been manipulating events from
                behind the
                scenes.

                Throughout Destiny 2, players have battled against various alien races, including the Fallen, Hive, Vex,
                Cabal,
                and more, uncovering secrets of the universe and forging alliances to stand against the encroaching
                Darkness.
                The story continues to evolve with each new expansion, promising new adventures, challenges, and
                mysteries to
                uncover.
