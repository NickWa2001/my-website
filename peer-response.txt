Two things I enjoyed about your website is that your page layouts are consistent, and the content is easily understandable/readable. I checked for page breaks but all the pages resized well.

Three things you could fix/improve:

1. The first thing I noted was that your copy right could be moved to the bottom of the page in your footer.

2. The second is that I noticed there was some extra spacing between Titan class recommendations and Synthoceps.

3. Third is that there seems to be a lot of empty space in your Backstory and Nightfalls pages, maybe add some images.

****Fixed copyright symbol, fixed spacing, added lots of images and styling to the Backstory page.****

Nice layout and responsive site Nicholas.  Lots of information and a good amount of detail. It looks like all you need are a few pictures and your all done with the site. 
Good job so far Iâ€™m looking forward to the final product.

Hi Nicholas, I like how your website is easy to navigate, and your index page clearly defines what your website is about. Here are some suggestions for your site:

1. The copyright information on the home page isn't at the bottom; I think your flex box is moving your footer up.

2. The "Nightfalls" page looks really good at most screen sizes, but around 1000px and larger the information looks a little too spaced out.

3. I liked how you formatted the class recommendations and farming strategies, but I feel like they could go on their own page so the home page doesn't get too cluttered.

Great job so far!
