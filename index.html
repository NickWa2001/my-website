        <h1 class="Intro">Destiny 2 is a Shooter-Looter MMO, with a focus on fun gunplay and using abilities like you're in a fantasy
            game.</h1>
        <p class="Intro">
            Hello! This website is going to help players with some experience in Destiny 2 become able to challenge
            themselves with end-game content without having to work very hard. Endgame content is intimidating because
            of
            the power level of the enemies you face and the difficulty of staying
            alive. Nothing is more punishing in Destiny than Grandmaster Nightfalls and Master-level Dungeons and Raids.

            So: You want to play endgame content. I'll be the first to tell you that you don't <em>need</em> everything
            or
            anything on here. However, if you don't have these weapons and armor pieces, it's going to be much, much
            harder.

        I find <a href="https://www.light.gg/"> this website </a> to be especially useful for finding out about good
        perk rolls on weapons.
