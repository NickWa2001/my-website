        <h2>Understanding Nightfalls:</h2>
        <p>
            Nightfalls are high-level PvE activities that offer increased difficulty and unique modifiers compared to
            regular strikes. These modifiers can affect enemy behavior, player abilities, and overall mission
            difficulty.
            Understanding these modifiers is crucial for planning your approach.
        </p>
        <h2>Communication and Coordination:</h2>
        <p>
            Communication is key to success in Nightfalls. Make sure to communicate with your fireteam throughout the
            activity. Discuss strategies, call out enemy positions, coordinate super abilities, and support each other
            during tough encounters.
        </p>
        <h2>Loadout Preparation:</h2>
        <p>
            Before starting a Nightfall, ensure that you have a well-rounded loadout that covers different enemy types
            and
            situations. This includes a mix of weapons with different elemental damage types to match enemy shields, as
            well
            as armor mods that complement your playstyle and provide additional benefits.
        </p>
        <h2>Scout the Strike:</h2>
        <p>
            Take some time to scout the Nightfall before starting. Pay attention to enemy placements, potential ambush
            points, and areas where you can take cover. Knowing the layout of the strike will help you plan your
            approach
            and avoid unnecessary risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Adaptability:</h2>
        <p>
            Be prepared to adapt your strategies on the fly. Nightfalls can throw unexpected challenges your way, such
            as
            Champion enemies or environmental hazards. Stay flexible, and be willing to adjust your tactics based on the
            situation.
        </p>
        <h2>Time Management:</h2>
        <p>
            Keep an eye on the timer and manage your time effectively. While it's important to move efficiently, rushing
            too
            much can lead to mistakes and wipes. Find a balance between speed and caution, and prioritize staying alive
            over
            completing objectives quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>Teamwork:</h2>
        <p>
            Nightfalls are designed to be completed with a fireteam, so teamwork is essential. Support your teammates,
            revive them when needed, and coordinate your actions to overcome tough encounters. Remember that you're
            stronger
            together than you are alone.
        </p>
        <h2>Learn from Mistakes:</h2>
        <p>
            Don't get discouraged by failures. Nightfalls can be challenging, and it's normal to encounter setbacks
            along
            the way. Take each wipe as an opportunity to learn from your mistakes, refine your strategies, and improve
            as a
            team.
        </p>
        <h2>Celebrate Successes:</h2>
        <p>
            When you finally complete a Nightfall, take a moment to celebrate your achievement. Whether it's your first
            completion or your tenth, completing a Nightfall is always a satisfying accomplishment. Enjoy the moment,
            and
            feel proud of what you've accomplished as a team.
